- **Add New Numbers**: Dynamically add new numbers to the bingo pool.
- **Check Bingo**: Verify if a specific set of numbers forms a bingo by checking against withdrawn numbers, with success or failure sound notifications.

Featuring **Christmas-inspired sound effects**, the game adds a festive touch to the bingo experience. From jingles to celebratory win sounds, the sound design enhances the holiday atmosphere, making the game more fun and immersive.

The app is designed for both casual and serious bingo players, offering a variety of interactive features with a fun and engaging user experience.
